# About me

I am a full stack developer based in Aix-en-Provence, France. From small programs to large scale architectures, from 
widgets to libraries, I focus on maintaining a strict workflow to build clean and reusable environments.
Creating useful and original content is what I love to do.

I also love to write, about [lots of stuff](https://www.alexisphilip.fr/blog).

# Things I like to do

- Programming;
- Building things (keyboards, mainly);
- 3D printing;
- Piano;
- Solving weird puzzles, like giant Rubik's Cubes.
