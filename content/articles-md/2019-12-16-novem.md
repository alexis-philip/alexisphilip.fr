*NOVEM* (means *nine* in Latin) is a homemade, 3D printed, programmable keypad. After I got my first 3D printer,
I decided to print my own keyboard plates and cases. To see if the mechanical switches would hold onto the plastic
plates instead of the aluminium ones, I decided to create a small keypad to try it out. That's how *NOVEM* is born!

## Pieces used

All the parts used to make *NOVEM* a whole:
- 9 cherry MX switches ;
- 9 1N4148 diodes ;
- 9 3D printed keycaps ;
- 1 3D printed case ;
- 1 ATmega32U4 microprocessor ;
- 1 3D printed top plate & 1 3D printed bottom plate ;
- 6 3D printed support feet ;
- 6 M2 screws.

## Design

I designed the whole keypad on the 3D software [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com). I wanted the top plate to show
off the microprocessor and the diodes next to the 9 keys.

## Building

### Printing

I printed all the parts with a Creality Ender 3. The extruder size is 0.4 mm, and I set the precision to 0.12 mm at
100% infill. The total print time for all the parts was around 12 hours.

### Wiring

Keyboards follow an electronic wiring matrix pattern (see [PUCH keyboard](https://www.alexisphilip.fr/puch#solderingswitches)
for an example). However, on *NOVEM*, things work out differently. Since the microprocessor and the diodes are on the
outside of the case, the wiring is going to be longer.

The wiring was quite challenging. Taking your time in that kind of moment is important to avoid making a short and
having to desolder your wiring.

### Programming

I used [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) to program the microcontroller.

I explained a little more what QMK is on my article about [PUCH](https://www.alexisphilip.fr/puch#programming). 

## Conclusion

The switches hold nicely on the 3D printed plate, and the 3D printed keycaps feel nice.

*NOVEM* is a success! I am now ready to build a larger keyboard using 3D printed parts instead of aluminium and wood.
