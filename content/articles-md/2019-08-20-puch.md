*PUCH* is a handmade, ergonomic, ortholinear, programmable keyboard.

As a programmer, I use the arrow keys... All the time. I quickly found it poorly ergonomic to always get my hands of the home row to reach those keys. I then decided to build my own keyboard, with a more ergonomic layout that I could program myself.

## Budget

**Materials: ~122 €** (~$147)

**Tools: ~23 €** (~$27)

> Total costs can be lowered if you 3D print your own bottom and top plates, and if you already own soldering tools/materials.

Materials:
- 59 switches: 17 €;
- 59 keycaps: 20 €;
- 54 1N4148 diodes: 2 €;
- 1 microcontroller (ATmega32U4): 2 €;
- 1 micro USB female connector: 0.5 €;
- 1 micro USB male connector: 0.5 €;
- top & bottom plate: 75 €;
- wires: 5 €;
- solder: 7 €;
- M2 screw and nuts: 1 €;

Tools:
- soldering iron: 18 €;
- desoldering pump: 3 €;
- desoldering wire: 2 €.

## Design

To build the keyboard, I needed one aluminium top plate and bottom plate.

I chose to build an ortholinear layout. I designed the layout to the correct dimensions on Adobe Illustrator.

I then sent the file to LaserBoost, which laser cut my top & bottom plates design on aluminium.

## Building

### Soldering switches

I bought 59 Cherry MX Red switches, and I soldered them in a matrix pattern.

After soldering them together, I connected them to the ATmega32U4 microcontroller.

    I soldered a first MCU which was not working, so I replaced it by a ATmega32U4.

### Wooden enclosure

I built a wooden enclosure which fits between the top and bottom plates. I made an enclosure in it for the micro USB female port.

Last steps were sanding and oiling the wood.

## Programming

I used [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) to program the microcontroller. It is a keyboard open source firmware which produces standard keyboard inputs understandable by most operating systems (Windows, all Linux distributions, macOS).

The [documentation](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) is really well-made and easy to understand for anyone.

I programmed a few macro/functions:
- autowrites my e-mail address;
- shortcuts for *arrow*, *home*, *end* keys and many others;
- shortcuts for French special characters.

## Conclusion

Building a keyboard taught me a lot about electronics, design, soldering, ergonomics and C language.

If you are interested in building your own keyboard with your own layout, building one yourself is possible, and you don't need any programming knowledge.

**UPDATE 2020-02-10**: I've been using this keyboard for about 6 months. Writing and programming feels much easier, and my workflow is smoother. Macros allow me to do things faster, and writing what I'm thinking is easier than before.
