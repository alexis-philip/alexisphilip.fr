## Todo

- add JS which adds meta description & to the elements
- add /demo/ parser
- /DOCS maybe ?
- blog date parser & modify btn;
- make categories & projects pages.
- make 404 page;

- documentent all functions;
- sticky header
- make JS which adds a copy of the link and modifies the URL to all titles in blog on click
- article link: <a> tag prevents putting other <a> tag for categories. Need JS for links:
  - or do everything with <a> tag and do hover with JS

## About me
- add icons to about me page
- maybe links to categories or GitHub (3d printing?)

## Animation
- add moving letters library on different elements such as h1, h2 titles and others. 
- maybe to links too?

## Social
